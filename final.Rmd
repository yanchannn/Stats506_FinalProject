## **Introduction**

Energy conservation is a hot issue nowadays. Energy can be conserved by reducing
wastage and losses, improving efficiency through technological upgrades and
improved operation and maintenance. In this project, I am working on the
problem:

**Do buildings with electrical upgrades in the past year consume less electricity than those without recent upgrades?**


## **Data / Methods**

I use the data from the 2012 US Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey 
[(CBECS)](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/2012) 

I will calculate the estimated mean building-level energy
intensity of the electricity (`bleu`) which is defined as 
**annual electricity consumption (`ELCNS`) / square foot (`SQFT`)** 
for buildings with recent electrical upgrades (`RENELC`) and those without.
The results are further stratified by the primary building activity (`PBA`) and 
geography (`REGION`).

I focus on five major building activity: office, warehouse, education,
shopping, and service when doing the analysis since these five categories have
more observations than others.

The first thing to do is to clean the data: select the observations in the five 
categories and remove rows with any missing value. Secondly, I use the statement
`PROC SURVEYMEANS` to calculate the estimated mean energy intensity of 
electricity and calculate the 95% confidence intervals using the replicate
weights (`FINALWT1-197`).

The source code can be accessed at my 
[Github repo](https://github.com/yanchannn/Stats506_FinalProject).

## **Results** {.tabset .tabset-pills}
### Figure
```{r plot, echo = FALSE}
cap = paste0(
  "**Figure 1.**Energy intensity of Electricity** ", 
  "This figure shows estimated mean energy intensity of electricity in 2012."
)
results %>%
  mutate(
    `Primary Building Activity` = activity,
    `Electrical Upgrade` = RENELC
  ) %>%
  ggplot( aes(y = Mean, x = REGION, color = `Electrical Upgrade`) ) +
  geom_point( position = position_dodge(width = .5), alpha = 0.5, size = 1) +
  geom_errorbar( 
    aes(ymin = LowerCLMean, ymax = UpperCLMean), 
    alpha = 0.5, 
    position = position_dodge(width = .5)
  ) + 
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~ `Primary Building Activity`) + 
  theme_bw() +
  ylab( "Mean energy intensity of electricity in 2012" ) +
  xlab('Region')
```

### Table
```{r table, echo = FALSE}
cap2 = paste0("**Table 1.**Energy intensity of Electricity in 2012**",
              "Numbers in parantheses represent 95% confidence intervals.")

results %>%
  transmute( 
    `Region` = REGION, 
    `Primary Building Activity` = activity,
    `Electrical Upgrade` = RENELC,
    `Mean energy intensity` = 
      sprintf('<div>%4.2f</div> <div>(%4.2f, %4.2f)</div>',
                     Mean, LowerCLMean,UpperCLMean)
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable(
    format = 'html', 
    escape = FALSE, 
    align = 'lllc',
    cap = cap2
  ) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling("striped", full_width = TRUE)

```


## **To-do**

- add conclusion

- perform t-test of the results and add p-values to the table
